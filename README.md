# Scooter Tangible Interface

<H2>Functionality</H2>
These packages will allow communication between a physical constructed user interface and the backend for the
scooter code via a serial connection. They also will allow the user to run the scooter via a script. This script will
only be able to interact with the tangible interface, and will have no input from the Computer.


Communication is done via a ROS Joy message.


Still under development
